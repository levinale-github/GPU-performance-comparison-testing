# **GPU Benchmarking & Performance Testing Repository – Design Document**

## **Introduction**

This design document outlines a comprehensive **GPU Benchmarking & Performance Testing** repository. The goal is to create a one-stop resource for both **new GPU users** and **professionals** to evaluate and compare graphics cards. Newcomers will find guidance on selecting the right GPU and understanding performance metrics, while advanced users can run in-depth benchmarks on various GPU features. The repository will provide ready-to-run benchmark scripts, a system for contributing and verifying results via GitHub pull requests, and a public dashboard for visualizing GPU performance data. By combining multiple open-source benchmarking tools and frameworks, the project aims to cover a wide range of GPU types (discrete desktop GPUs, integrated graphics, cloud GPUs, etc.) and use-cases. Ultimately, this repo will enable transparent, community-driven GPU performance comparisons – from **helping a novice pick a GPU** to **letting an expert measure PCIe bandwidth or compare an on-premise GPU vs a cloud instance**.

## **Audience & Use Cases**

* **New GPU Users:** Those who are unsure which graphics card to buy can use this repository as a guide. The README will include a “starter guide” with simple explanations and link to external resources like **BrainyBuyer** for GPU comparisons. For example, users can refer to BrainyBuyer’s Graphics Cards category to compare specs and prices of various GPU models (see **Graphics Cards** category on BrainyBuyer for detailed spec comparisons). The repository’s data will help illustrate differences between GPUs – e.g. how an integrated GPU in a laptop compares to a dedicated GPU in a desktop. New users can run basic benchmarks on their current hardware to gauge its performance and see how it stacks up against other cards in the community results. This helps in understanding whether an upgrade is needed and which GPU might offer the best value.

* **Professionals & Enthusiasts:** Experienced users, such as gamers, data scientists, and engineers, can use the repository to perform rigorous benchmarks on GPUs. They may want to test specific features (compute throughput, memory bandwidth, deep learning performance, etc.) or validate that a new GPU is performing as expected. For instance, a machine learning engineer could run the provided GPU compute tests to ensure a cloud VM’s GPU is delivering expected FLOPS, or a gamer could compare the memory bandwidth of an overclocked GPU to reference values. Professionals can also contribute their results back to the repository, creating a crowdsourced database of GPU performance. The ability to compare **discrete vs. integrated GPUs** or **on-premise vs. cloud GPUs** side-by-side is valuable – e.g. showing how an integrated GPU is often bottlenecked by system memory bandwidth​[news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40235515#:~:text=Memory%20bandwidth%20is%20the%20major,ability%20to%20upgrade%20it%20yourself). The repository will also aid in **hardware evaluation and upgrade planning**: a professional could see that a new generation GPU provides X% improvement on certain workloads, or that renting a GPU in the cloud yields Y performance at Z cost, and make decisions accordingly.

## **Key Features**

The project will provide several core features to satisfy the above use cases:

* **Comprehensive Benchmark Suite:** A collection of ready-to-run benchmark tests targeting different aspects of GPU performance. This includes low-level microbenchmarks (memory bandwidth, compute throughput) and high-level workload benchmarks (3D rendering, machine learning inference, etc.). Multiple open-source tools and frameworks will be integrated to ensure broad coverage of GPU types and platforms. The suite should be cross-platform and support **NVIDIA, AMD, and integrated GPUs** via common APIs (OpenCL, Vulkan, etc.), with optional CUDA/ROCm-specific tests for deeper analysis on respective hardware.

* **Verifiable Results Contribution:** External users can run the benchmarks and submit their results via GitHub pull requests. Each submitted result must include metadata and raw logs to allow verification and reproduction of the numbers. For example, if a user submits a benchmark result for a “GeForce RTX 3080”, they would also attach the output log or a generated report from the benchmarking script. This ensures transparency – similar to how the Phoronix Test Suite archives system and test logs for each run​[phoronix-test-suite.com](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/#:~:text=Result%20Recording). A standardized **results format** (e.g. JSON or CSV) will be defined so that all contributions include key details (GPU model, driver version, test settings, scores, etc.). The repository maintainers (or automated CI) will verify that the numbers match the logs before accepting the contribution. This verifiability is crucial to build trust in the data. (Inspiration is taken from existing frameworks like Phoronix, which emphasize reproducible and credible results​[phoronix-test-suite.com](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/#:~:text=The%20Phoronix%20Test%20Suite%20is,continuous%20integration%20%2F%20performance%20management)​[phoronix-test-suite.com](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/#:~:text=Result%20Recording).)

* **Public Performance Dashboard:** The repository’s data will feed into a public dashboard website for easy visualization. Users will be able to see graphs and tables comparing GPU performance metrics across all submitted results. For example, one chart might compare FPS or GFLOPS of various GPUs, or show memory bandwidth of an integrated GPU vs a discrete GPU. The dashboard will make it simple to filter by GPU model, vendor, or test type and to spot trends. We plan to host this dashboard using a free service (such as **Vercel** or GitHub Pages) so that it updates automatically as new results are added. The dashboard could be a static site (generated from the results data in the repo) or a small web app that pulls the latest data from the repository JSON files. This approach ensures anyone can access the performance comparisons without needing to run code. The design of the dashboard will prioritize clarity – e.g. interactive graphs for select metrics, and summary tables highlighting top performers in different categories (compute, memory, gaming, etc.).

* **Physical vs Cloud GPU Support (Cost Analysis):** The benchmark scripts will be designed to run on both physical GPUs (in a PC or workstation) and cloud-based GPUs (such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud instances). We recognize that some users may not own high-end GPUs but can rent them in the cloud, or conversely, some want to know if buying hardware is worth it. Therefore, each result submission will have an optional **cost annotation**: the contributor can input the approximate retail price of their GPU (if physical) or the hourly cost of the cloud instance. The repository will then calculate a “**cloud break-even hours**” metric – essentially how many hours of cloud GPU usage would equal the cost of the physical GPU. For example, if a GPU costs $1,500 and a similar cloud GPU costs about $3/hour to rent, roughly 500 hours of cloud use would cost the same​[medium.com](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-building-your-own-deep-learning-computer-is-10x-cheaper-than-aws-b1c91b55ce8c#:~:text=Cloud%20GPU%20machines%20are%20expensive,you%E2%80%99re%20not%20using%20the%20machine). This provides insight into cost-effectiveness; a small note might accompany each GPU’s results on the dashboard, like “≈500 hours to break-even vs cloud.” It’s well-documented that owning a GPU can be much cheaper in the long run if utilization is high (on the order of **4–10× cheaper over a year of use** in some cases)​[medium.com](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-building-your-own-deep-learning-computer-is-10x-cheaper-than-aws-b1c91b55ce8c#:~:text=Building%20is%2010x%20cheaper%20than,and%20is%20just%20as%20performant). By including a cost analysis field, the project helps users consider **performance per dollar**, not just raw speed. In summary, the repository will support both local and cloud benchmarking scenarios and make the **cost-performance trade-offs** clear​[github.com](https://github.com/liquidweb/gpubench#:~:text=With%20comparative%20scoring%2C%20users%20can,achieve%20the%20optimal%20performance%3A%24%20ratio).

## **Benchmark Suite Design**

In order to cover the wide range of performance aspects, the benchmarking suite will leverage multiple open-source tools, each suited to a particular aspect of GPU performance. Rather than reinventing all wheels, we’ll integrate or wrap existing benchmarks where possible, and write new tests where needed. Key components of the suite include:

* **Memory Bandwidth Tests:** Measuring how quickly data can be moved to, from, and within the GPU. For example, we will include tests analogous to the classic “STREAM” benchmark but for GPUs (often called GPU-STREAM​[sc15.supercomputing.org](https://sc15.supercomputing.org/sites/all/themes/SC15images/tech_poster/poster_files/post150s2-file3.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20GPU,a%20wide%20range%20of%20hardware)), which measure device memory bandwidth (GB/s). We also plan to test **PCIe transfer speed** for data transfer between CPU and GPU (this helps evaluate the impact of PCIe gen3 vs gen4, etc., and is especially relevant for external GPUs or multi-GPU setups). These tests might use simple CUDA or OpenCL programs to copy large buffers and report throughput. (Notably, tools like GPUBench implement similar memory and transfer tests​[github.com](https://github.com/liquidweb/gpubench#:~:text=,for%20inference%20throughput%20and%20latency).)

* **Compute Performance Tests:** Evaluating the raw processing power of GPUs. We will use or build kernels to measure peak FLOPS in various precisions (FP32, FP16, INT8, etc.), possibly using a tool like **clpeak** (an open-source program that reports peak compute capabilities on OpenCL devices). Additionally, **MixBench**​[github.com](https://github.com/ekondis/mixbench#:~:text=Four%20types%20of%20experiments%20are,combined%20with%20global%20memory%20accesses) (which runs kernels of mixed memory/computation intensity) can be included to see how the GPU handles different workloads. These low-level tests give a sense of the GPU’s ALU throughput and its ability to hide latency by parallelism. The suite will report metrics like GFLOPS (giga floating-point operations per second) for different data types. Where supported, we may also include **tensor core** tests for NVIDIA (via CUDA) to measure specialized matrix-multiply hardware performance (useful for ML workloads).

* **Rendering and Graphics Tests:** For users interested in gaming or graphics, the suite will incorporate a few graphic-oriented benchmarks. We intend to use **GLMark2** (an OpenGL benchmark​[wiki.sharewiz.net](https://wiki.sharewiz.net/doku.php?id=ubuntu:gpu:benchmark_the_gpu:gl_mark_2#:~:text=Ubuntu%20,of%20the%20GPU%20performance)) or similar to measure 3D rendering performance with standard scenes, which produces an overall score. Another possible inclusion is **LuxCoreRender** or **Blender** GPU rendering of a sample scene (both are open source: e.g., rendering the **Blender Classroom** or **BMW scene** on the GPU). These tests simulate real-world GPU rendering performance. (The Phoronix Test Suite, for instance, includes Blender and LuxCore render benchmarks as part of its GPU suites​[openbenchmarking.org](https://openbenchmarking.org/suite/pts/nvidia-gpu-compute#:~:text=Image%3A%20IndigoBench).) By including at least one graphics benchmark, the repository serves gamers and creators who want to compare GPUs on image rendering tasks, not just synthetic compute.

* **Compute Workload Tests (AI/HPC):** To reflect practical GPU usage in compute, we plan to include a couple of small **machine learning** or **HPC** workload benchmarks. For example, a **neural network inference** test using a framework like PyTorch could measure how many images per second a GPU can classify with a ResNet-50 model (this tests both compute and memory, and is highly relevant for AI practitioners). Similarly, we might include a **GPU-accelerated science** workload (e.g., a molecular dynamics simulation step from **GROMACS**, or a cryptography hash test from **Hashcat**), to represent HPC or compute-intensive tasks. These provide context for how GPUs perform on real algorithms. There are many existing tests we can script – e.g. running **Hashcat** on a known hash and measuring hash/s, or running a small **matrix multiplication** benchmark. By using established tools (like ArrayFire, TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc.), we ensure the tests are relevant and can run on multiple hardware. The suite’s design is modular so new tests can be added easily; this follows the extensible approach of platforms like Phoronix Test Suite which support hundreds of test profiles​[phoronix-test-suite.com](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/#:~:text=Extensible%20Architecture).

**Cross-Platform Considerations:** All benchmarks will be designed to run on **Linux and Windows** at minimum, possibly macOS if feasible (for example, OpenCL tests could run on Macs with Intel or Apple Silicon GPUs, though Apple’s Metal would need separate handling). Where possible, we use cross-platform tools (OpenCL, Vulkan, or platform-agnostic programs). For NVIDIA GPUs, CUDA-specific tests will require the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit; for AMD, ROCm or HIP could be leveraged. We will provide clear instructions in the README for any platform-specific setup (e.g., needing drivers or certain libraries). The repository may also include Docker containers or environment files to help users set up a consistent environment for running the benchmarks.

## **Repository Structure**

To organize the project, the repository will be structured into directories for benchmarks, results, documentation, and the dashboard. A proposed layout is as follows:

plaintext  
Copy  
`gpu-benchmarks/               # Repository root`  
`├── benchmarks/               # Benchmark suites and scripts`  
`│   ├── memory/               # Memory and bandwidth tests`  
`│   ├── compute/              # Compute (ALU/Tensor) tests`  
`│   ├── graphics/             # Graphics/rendering tests`  
`│   ├── ai/                   # AI/ML benchmarks`  
`│   └── ...                   # (each subfolder contains scripts or instructions)`  
`├── results/                  # Contributed results data`  
`│   ├── submissions/          # Individual submissions (raw data and logs)`  
`│   └── aggregated_results.csv/json   # Aggregated data for dashboard`  
`├── docs/                     # Additional docs (if any, e.g., methodology, FAQ)`  
`├── dashboard/                # Dashboard website code (if using a static site in repo)`  
`│   └── … (files for web app or static HTML/JS)`  
`├── README.md                 # Starter guide and introduction for users`  
`└── CONTRIBUTING.md           # Guidelines for contributing (results or code)`

* The **`benchmarks/`** directory contains subfolders for each category of tests. Each will have its own README or instructions, plus any source code or scripts needed to run that set of tests. For example, `benchmarks/memory/` might contain a Python or C++ script for the memory bandwidth test, and `benchmarks/graphics/` might include a shell script that runs GLMark2 or a Blender benchmark. We will script the benchmarks so that running them is straightforward (perhaps a top-level runner script that invokes all tests, or individual scripts per test with standardized output).

* The **`results/`** directory is where user-submitted results reside. In `results/submissions/`, each contribution could be a folder or file named by GPU and contributor (for instance, `RTX3080_User123.json` or a folder `submission_2025-04-10_User123_RTX3080/` containing both results and log file). We will define a naming scheme that encodes GPU model and maybe a submission date or ID. This makes it easier to track multiple submissions for the same GPU model. The `aggregated_results.json` (or CSV) will be an updated file combining key data from all submissions – this is what the dashboard reads to generate comparisons. This aggregated file can be programmatically built by a script whenever new results are merged (or even automated via a GitHub Action).

* **Documentation:** The main user-facing documentation will be the **README.md** (included as a template later in this doc) and possibly a **CONTRIBUTING.md** for more detailed developer info. If needed, `docs/` can hold extra guides, like how to add a new benchmark, or detailed methodology for each test.

* **Dashboard:** If the dashboard is a static site (e.g., built with Next.js or just vanilla HTML/JS), those files will live under `dashboard/` or a separate branch (if using GitHub Pages). However, using a service like Vercel means the site might be in its own repo or branch. For now, we assume the dashboard code can be part of this repo for transparency. The site will fetch or include the `aggregated_results.json` to render charts.

This structure is designed to separate concerns: benchmarks code vs results data vs presentation. It will also make it easier for contributors – for example, someone adding a new benchmark will modify the `benchmarks/` area, whereas someone submitting results will only add files under `results/`.

## **Result Submission Workflow**

Because one of the core ideas is community-contributed performance data, we outline a clear workflow for submitting and verifying results:

1. **Running Benchmarks:** A user will clone the repository and run either a master script (e.g., `run_all_benchmarks.py`) or individual benchmark scripts. We will ensure that running a test produces an **output file** (JSON/CSV) summarizing the results and also saves a **log file** with details. For example, `run_all_benchmarks.py` might output `results/MyGPU_results.json` plus logs of console output in `results/MyGPU_run.log`. The JSON could contain entries like `{ "GPU": "NVIDIA RTX 3080", "Test": "MemoryBandwidth", "Result": "450 GB/s", ... }` for each test.

2. **Preparing Submission:** The user then forks the repository and adds their result file and log. They might place the JSON in `results/submissions/` as per structure. We will provide a script or instructions to **append their data to the aggregated CSV/JSON** in a standardized way. (Alternatively, maintainers can do the aggregation, but a script allows contributors to preview how their data will be added.) We will ask the contributor to also update a simple README or table listing results (if we maintain one in text form) – or this can be auto-generated from the aggregate file.

3. **Pull Request Checks:** When the contributor opens a PR with their results, maintainers (or automated CI jobs) will review the submission. Key points to verify:

   * The result data format is correct and all required fields (GPU model, test names, scores, environment info like driver version) are present.

   * The log file is attached and the numbers in the JSON match what the log output shows (to prevent accidental typos or malicious data). For example, if the JSON claims 500 GB/s bandwidth but the log shows 480 GB/s, we’d ask for correction. This is where verifiability matters – since the logs are included, anyone can double-check the authenticity of the results.

   * Optionally, for large changes or new GPU models, maintainers might run one of the tests on their side (if possible) to sanity-check the results. Over time, as we build trust and maybe even automated test reproduction, this process can be streamlined.

4. **Merging and Publishing:** Once verified, the PR is merged. The new JSON (and log) becomes part of the repository. We then update the `aggregated_results.json` (which could be done manually, or via a GitHub Action that triggers on merge). After that, the dashboard site will automatically update (if using a static JSON, we might just fetch the latest from the GitHub raw URL; if using a static build, we might need to trigger a rebuild/deploy on Vercel). The contributor’s data is now publicly visible on the dashboard for all to see and compare.

5. **Maintaining Data Quality:** We will maintain a **metadata table** of GPUs (perhaps in a YAML or CSV file) where each GPU model has normalized specifications (vendor, VRAM, etc.). This helps ensure consistency when aggregating data. For instance, one contributor might write “GeForce RTX 3060 Ti” and another “NVIDIA RTX 3060Ti”; we’ll normalize these under a single key so that the dashboard doesn’t list them separately. Contributors will be asked to use a standard name (we can provide a list in the README or a script that validates names).

Additionally, each result entry might have an *environment hash* or description (e.g., OS, driver, exact test version) – if results differ wildly, this can help explain (perhaps someone used an older driver or a debug build of a test, etc.). Including system info and logs will uphold the principle of reproducible research, echoing the importance of **transparent benchmarking** from academic and industry best practices​[phoronix-test-suite.com](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/#:~:text=Result%20Recording).

## **Dashboard & Visualization Details**

The public dashboard is a crucial part of this project, as it turns raw data into insights. Here we detail how it will be implemented and what features it will have:

* **Technology:** We plan to start with a simple static dashboard. This could be a single HTML page (with embedded JavaScript code for charts) that reads a JSON file from the repository. Libraries like **D3.js** or **Chart.js** can be used to generate interactive charts (bar graphs for throughput, scatter plots for comparisons, etc.). Using Vercel for hosting, we can automatically deploy on each push. Alternatively, a minimal **Next.js** app could be created in the `dashboard/` folder which, upon build, fetches the latest data and generates pages. The aim is to avoid any need for a server-side database – the GitHub repo itself is the database of results.

* **Visualizations:** The dashboard will likely include:

  * A **summary table** of GPUs with key metrics. For example, a table where each row is a GPU model and columns show metrics like memory bandwidth (GB/s), single-precision TFLOPS, 3D render score, etc. This gives a quick at-a-glance comparison.

  * **Interactive charts:** e.g., a bar chart for a specific test. The user could select “Memory Bandwidth” and see all tested GPUs plotted. Another chart might show “FPS in graphics test” or “Images/sec in ResNet inference” for those GPUs that ran that test.

  * **Filtering and grouping:** Users might filter the view to only show discrete GPUs or only integrated GPUs, or compare a subset (like select 2-3 GPUs to highlight). For instance, a user could filter to “Integrated Graphics” and see that they cluster at lower performance in many tests (due to memory bottlenecks​[news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40235515#:~:text=Memory%20bandwidth%20is%20the%20major,ability%20to%20upgrade%20it%20yourself)), then switch to “Discrete GPUs” to see the range there.

  * **Cost comparison:** Beside performance data, we can include a visual indicator of cost-effectiveness. Perhaps a chart of performance vs cost – e.g., GFLOPS per $ or similar. Or a simple annotation in the table like “Cost per hour (cloud) \= $X, break-even Y hours”. This will be based on the cost info contributors provide. For example, if an RTX 3080 is $700 and a similar cloud instance is $2.50/h, the dashboard might note “≈280 hours to amortize cost” (700/2.5). Users can quickly grasp whether a GPU is worth buying or if renting makes sense for their usage level. The importance of tracking performance per dollar is underscored by industry usage – some benchmarking tools encourage comparing cloud providers for optimal **performance:$ ratio**​[github.com](https://github.com/liquidweb/gpubench#:~:text=With%20comparative%20scoring%2C%20users%20can,achieve%20the%20optimal%20performance%3A%24%20ratio).

* **Update Frequency:** Because the data updates only when new results are merged, we don’t expect extremely frequent changes. A manual trigger or automated deploy on new commits to main branch will keep the dashboard updated. We will document the process so that maintainers know how to push updates. If using GitHub Pages, the site might rebuild from latest JSON on each commit via a GitHub Action.

* **Future Enhancements:** Later on, we could incorporate more sophisticated visualization (like trending performance over time if we re-test hardware with new drivers, etc.) or even allow users to query and download the dataset for their own analysis. For now, the goal is to make the comparison **easy to interpret for a broad audience** – whether it’s a gamer checking if a GTX 1660 Super is enough for their needs, or a researcher seeing how a Tesla A100 in the cloud compares to their RTX 3090 locally.

## **Phased Implementation Roadmap**

We will implement this project in well-defined phases. Each phase is structured so that it can be taken on by an engineer or an autonomous coding agent relatively independently. The phases build upon each other to gradually achieve all the desired features:

1. **Phase 1: Repository Setup & Basic Benchmark**

   * **Scaffold the repository structure** as described above (create directories like `benchmarks/`, `results/`, etc., along with a basic README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md).

   * **Implement a simple benchmark script** as a proof of concept. For example, start with a GPU memory bandwidth test (perhaps a Python script using PyCUDA or PyOpenCL to transfer a buffer and measure GB/s). Ensure this script can run on at least one platform (e.g., Linux with CUDA) and produce a result output file.

   * **Document the usage** of this basic benchmark in the README (so that even at Phase 1, a user can clone and try it). For instance, “run `python benchmarks/memory/mem_bandwidth.py` to measure your GPU memory bandwidth.”

   * **Establish contribution guidelines** for results in CONTRIBUTING.md (even if we have no contributions yet, outline how someone *would* submit a result for this test).

   * *Outcome:* At the end of Phase 1, we have a minimal working repo: users can run one benchmark and we have a structure to accept its results. This phase sets the foundation for expansion.

2. **Phase 2: Expand Benchmark Suite (Core Tests)**

   * **Incorporate multiple benchmarking tools** covering the major categories (memory, compute, graphics, ML). Develop or integrate at least 3-5 tests: e.g., add a compute kernel benchmark (using clpeak or our own kernel to measure FLOPS), add a simple graphics test (maybe integrate glmark2 by providing a script that installs and runs it, or use an existing small 3D scene renderer), and add one AI inference test (use PyTorch to run a forward pass of a known model).

   * **Ensure cross-platform compatibility** in these tests. This may involve writing separate scripts or batch files for Windows vs Linux, or using a portable language. At minimum, test the core benchmarks on both a Windows machine (with an NVIDIA or AMD GPU) and a Linux machine. Adjust instructions accordingly in the docs (e.g., how to install dependencies on each OS).

   * **Automate result collection** for these tests. Perhaps create a unified runner (a Python script that calls each benchmark and collects all results into one JSON). This will simplify the process for contributors (one command runs all tests and produces a ready-to-submit file).

   * **Include sample results** in the repo for reference. For example, run the suite on a known GPU (say, an older GTX 1060\) and include that JSON in `results/` as “example result from GTX 1060 by maintainer”. This gives contributors a template to follow and also kickstarts the data pool.

   * *Outcome:* By Phase 2, the repository offers a basic but **multi-faceted benchmark suite**. Users can measure different aspects of GPU performance. The README is updated with these new tests and how to run them. We likely have a few reference results checked in.

3. **Phase 3: Contribution Mechanism & Data Verification**

   * **Implement the results submission workflow** in practice. Possibly create a small validation script that maintainers can run to verify a submitted JSON against a log (this could even be a CI job in GitHub Actions, where the PR triggers a check that parses the log and data). If feasible, implement this as an automated check to reduce manual effort.

   * **Refine the results format and metadata schema.** Based on Phase 2 experience, finalize what fields we want in the JSON/CSV (GPU name, vendor, driver, tests run, scores, units, etc.). Document this format clearly in CONTRIBUTING.md so contributors know how to format their data.

   * **Build an aggregation script** that merges individual results into the master dataset. This could be a simple Python script that reads all JSON files in `results/submissions/` and outputs one consolidated CSV/JSON. We can run this script whenever we merge a PR, or set it up as a pre-commit hook for maintainers. At this phase, running it manually is fine.

   * **Start accepting pull requests** from a few testers (perhaps internally or from early adopters) to trial the process. For example, have people run the suite on an AMD GPU, an Intel iGPU, etc., and submit data. Through this, improve documentation clarity (maybe we find that we need to explain how to get OpenCL drivers for Intel, or how to enable High Performance mode on laptops for consistent results, etc.).

   * *Outcome:* After Phase 3, the project has a functioning **community contribution model**. We have handled a few sample PRs, ironed out the procedure, and ensured that all data in the repo is reliable and consistently formatted. We likely have a modest collection of results, which sets the stage for building the dashboard.

4. **Phase 4: Dashboard Development & Deployment**

   * **Develop the dashboard site** within the repository. Start with a simple static page that reads the aggregated results. Use a charting library to create a few key visualizations (e.g., bar chart of one metric). Iterate on the design – ensure that the page is easy to read, and maybe add interactive controls for filtering if possible without backend.

   * **Integrate the cost analysis into the dashboard.** This might involve adding a calculated column “Break-even hours” to the data and displaying it. Possibly show a small note under each GPU’s name with its cost info that was provided. Ensure the BrainyBuyer link or other guidance is visible for those wanting to research GPUs (the README will have it; we might also put a link on the dashboard saying “Need help choosing a GPU? See our starter guide.”).

   * **Host the dashboard for public access.** We will set up continuous deployment on Vercel (connecting the GitHub repo to Vercel so that any push to main triggers a deploy). Alternatively, enable GitHub Pages and host the static files from the `docs/` or `dashboard/` folder. Document the chosen approach in the design. If using Vercel, use a free tier project. We’ll test that the site loads the latest data correctly.

   * **Polish the UI/UX:** Make sure the charts have legends, units, and that the site is mobile-friendly (if possible). At this stage, it’s okay if the dashboard is basic; the key is that it accurately presents the data and updates with minimal effort.

   * *Outcome:* By the end of Phase 4, we have a **live dashboard** (e.g., `gpu-benchmarks.vercel.app` or GitHub Pages link) where anyone can view the compiled results. The repository README will be updated to prominently link to this dashboard. Now the project delivers value not just as code, but as an information hub.

5. **Phase 5: Extended Features & Maintenance**

   * **Add more benchmarks and tests** based on community interest. For example, if not already included, we might add a **stress test** (to check GPU thermal throttling over time), or additional game/engine benchmarks if open-source ones are available. We could integrate the **Phoronix Test Suite (PTS)** in an optional capacity – e.g., provide a shell script that runs a certain PTS GPU suite and parses the result, for those who have PTS installed. (PTS is very extensive and already automates a lot​[phoronix-test-suite.com](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/#:~:text=The%20Phoronix%20Test%20Suite%20makes,download%2Finstallation%2C%20execution%2C%20and%20result%20aggregation), so leveraging it could instantly expand our test coverage – but we need to simplify its output for our use.)

   * **Improve automation:** Possibly set up a CI pipeline to automatically run the benchmark suite on a schedule on a given machine (if hardware is available) to gather consistent baseline data and catch any issues. This could be tricky as GitHub Actions runners typically don’t have GPUs; but perhaps using self-hosted runners or services that allow hardware access (some cloud CI with GPU instances) could be explored. This would ensure our tests remain runnable and could provide a continuous performance baseline for a reference GPU.

   * **Community expansion:** Encourage more users to contribute. This may involve improving ease-of-use: for instance, creating a one-click script or installer that sets up everything needed to run (to lower the barrier for non-developers). We might also implement features like comparing two specific submissions (to see differences in configuration) or adding tags to submissions (e.g., one could tag their result as “overclocked” vs “stock”).

   * **Maintenance:** Regularly update the repository as GPUs and software evolve. When new GPU architectures release, add them to the compatibility list. Update benchmarks if new versions of tools come out (e.g., if a new version of Blender or an updated ML model is more relevant). Also monitor for any issues – e.g., if a benchmark is found to be unreliable or biased (maybe it favors one vendor), document that or replace it. The project should remain **vendor-neutral and transparent**, focusing on factual performance data.

   * *Outcome:* Phase 5 is ongoing – the repository grows more comprehensive and stays up-to-date. In the long term, we aim for this project to be self-sustaining through community contributions, much like how open-source software benchmarks (e.g., OpenBenchmarking/Phoronix) thrive by user submissions and feedback​[phoronix-test-suite.com](https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/#:~:text=The%20Phoronix%20Test%20Suite%20is,continuous%20integration%20%2F%20performance%20management). We’ll continuously strive to make it **extensible, reproducible, and easy-to-use**, echoing the principles of successful benchmarking platforms.

With this phased approach, each stage delivers a usable increment of functionality. We can prioritize initial usefulness (by giving users something to run and data to see early on), while laying the groundwork for the more complex features (like the dashboard and broad test coverage) to come in later phases. Each phase can be taken as a “project” by a developer or an AI agent, guided by the specifications above.

## **README.md Template**

Finally, we provide a template for the repository’s README.md – the starter guide that will welcome users and contributors to the project. This README should be clear and inviting, helping users quickly understand how to use the benchmarks and how to contribute. It also links to BrainyBuyer for GPU selection help, per requirements.

`# GPU Benchmarking & Performance Testing Suite`

`Welcome to the **GPU Benchmarking & Performance Testing** repository! This project is a community-driven effort to measure and compare the performance of various graphics cards and GPU accelerators. Whether you’re a newcomer trying to decide on your first GPU, or a seasoned pro benchmarking the latest hardware, this repo has something for you.`

`## Introduction`  
`**What is this repository?**`    
`It’s a one-stop collection of GPU benchmark tests and results. We provide easy-to-run scripts that test different aspects of GPU performance – from memory bandwidth and compute power to gaming and machine learning workloads. We also aggregate results submitted by the community so you can compare how different GPUs perform.`

`**Who is it for?**`    
`- *Curious about GPUs:* If you’re not sure which graphics card to buy or want to understand the differences between models, you can use our guides and results to inform your decision.`    
`- *Hardware enthusiasts and professionals:* If you own a GPU (or several!), you can run our test suite to measure its performance. You can even contribute your results to our public database and see how your setup stacks up against others.`

`## Getting Started`

`### Prerequisites`  
`- **Python 3.x** (for running the benchmark scripts and tools)`  
`- **GPU Drivers**: Ensure you have the proper drivers installed for your GPU. For NVIDIA, install the CUDA drivers; for AMD, install Radeon drivers or ROCm (on Linux). For integrated GPUs (Intel/AMD APUs), make sure the graphics driver is up to date.`  
`- Some benchmarks use additional tools:`  
  `- *OpenCL:* Many tests use OpenCL for cross-platform compatibility. Install an OpenCL runtime for your GPU (e.g., Intel OpenCL drivers for iGPUs, AMD APP SDK for AMD GPUs if not already in driver).`    
  `- *Optional:* If on Linux, you can install **glmark2** for the graphics test via your package manager. On Windows, our script will download a pre-built GLMark2 or use a simple DirectX sample.`  
  ``- *Python libraries:* If any Python benchmarks are included (e.g., for ML), install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (we will include a requirements file as needed).``

`### Running the Benchmarks`  
`To run the full benchmark suite, clone this repository and execute the main script:`  
```` ```bash ````  
`git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/gpu-benchmarks.git`    
`cd gpu-benchmarks`    
`python run_benchmarks.py`  

This will sequentially run all the tests in the suite. **Please be patient**, as some tests (especially rendering or deep learning tasks) may take a few minutes. When it completes, you will see a summary of results in your terminal, and a results file (e.g., `results/myGPU_results.json`) will be generated.

If you prefer to run individual tests (for example, just the memory bandwidth test), you can run the specific script. For instance:

bash  
Copy  
`python benchmarks/memory/mem_bandwidth.py`  

(Above is just an example; check the `benchmarks/` folder for the actual script names and usage instructions for each test.)

### **Sample Output**

After a successful run, your results file might look like this (in JSON format for example):

json  
Copy  
`{`  
  `"GPU": "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti",`  
  `"Driver": "GeForce 472.12 (Windows 10)",`  
  `"Memory_Bandwidth": "484.5 GB/s",`  
  `"Single-Precision_GFLOPS": 11200,`  
  `"Double-Precision_GFLOPS": 350,`  
  `"GLMark2_Score": 7500,`  
  `"ResNet50_Inference_ips": 225,`  
  `"Timestamp": "2025-04-10T21:00:00Z"`  
`}`

*(The above is just illustrative – actual fields and tests may differ.)*

You will also have a detailed log file (e.g., `myGPU_run.log`) capturing the console output of each test. It’s a good idea to review it to ensure all tests ran correctly (no errors, GPU was utilized, etc.).

## **Viewing and Comparing Results**

All contributed results are visible on our **Public Dashboard**: **GPU Benchmark Dashboard**. There, you can interactively compare different GPUs on various metrics. For quick reference, we also maintain a **Results Summary** table in the results file in this repo.

Some things you can discover:

* Which GPU has the highest memory bandwidth, or the fastest AI inference speed.

* How integrated GPUs (like Intel Iris or AMD Radeon Vega in APUs) compare against discrete GPUs. (Spoiler: discrete GPUs are much faster, especially in memory-intensive tasks – system RAM is a bottleneck for integrated GPUs​[news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40235515#:~:text=Memory%20bandwidth%20is%20the%20major,ability%20to%20upgrade%20it%20yourself).)

* The performance difference between GPU generations (e.g., RTX 20 series vs RTX 30 series).

* How a cloud GPU instance (like an AWS Tesla T4) compares to a consumer desktop GPU you might have at home.

## **Contributing Your Results**

**We welcome contributions\!** If you’ve run the benchmarks on your GPU, you can submit your results to be included in our database. Here’s how:

1. **Run the benchmarks** using the instructions above. Ensure you get a results file (JSON/CSV) and save the log file.

2. **Fork this repository** (click the “Fork” button in GitHub).

3. **Add your results** in the `results/submissions/` folder. You can name the file descriptively, for example: `2025-04-10_NVIDIA_GTX1080Ti.json`. Include your log file in the fork as well (you can put it in a `logs/` subfolder or attach it to the PR – see CONTRIBUTING.md for details).

4. **(Optional) Update** the `results/aggregated_results.csv` by running our provided aggregation script (`python tools/combine_results.py`) – this will pull in your new data. If you’re not comfortable doing this, don’t worry, maintainers can do it.

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your fork to this repo’s `main` branch. In the PR description, mention what GPU and driver the results are for, and any notes (if, say, you did something special like overclocking).

6. A maintainer will review your submission. They will check the data format and may cross-verify with your log. If everything looks good, we’ll merge it in\! After merge, the dashboard will update and your GPU’s results will be part of the public comparison.

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for more details on the process and data format. We want to ensure all results are **credible and reproducible**, so we might ask for clarifications. (For example, if a result is much higher than expected, we’ll double-check since consistency is key to trust.)

## **Choosing the Right GPU**

If you are new to GPUs and trying to make sense of the numbers: we have you covered\! We provide a brief guide here, and further resources:

* **Understand the Metrics:** Higher memory bandwidth means the GPU can feed data to its processors faster, which helps in data-heavy tasks. More FLOPS means more raw compute power. Scores in graphics tests correlate with gaming performance. No single number tells the whole story, so consider the workload you care about most.

* **Use Our Dashboard:** Filter by the type of workload that matters to you. For example, if you do a lot of 3D rendering, see which GPUs top the Blender or GLMark2 charts. If you do machine learning, look at the ResNet inference results or tensor core tests.

* **Compare GPU Specs:** It’s also useful to compare technical specs of GPUs side by side. We recommend using **BrainyBuyer’s Graphics Cards comparison tool** to directly compare specs and prices of GPUs you have in mind. You can visit BrainyBuyer – Graphics Cards Category​[brainybuyer.com](https://www.brainybuyer.com/compare?category=284822-1&product1=B0CCK7H82Z&product2=B00HSY1TBK#:~:text=GPU%20Clock%20Speed)​[brainybuyer.com](https://www.brainybuyer.com/compare?category=284822-1&product1=B0CCK7H82Z&product2=B00HSY1TBK#:~:text=Memory%20Bus%20Width) for a comprehensive list of cards and their specifications, and even do head-to-head comparisons of two models. This can complement our performance data with information on memory size, power consumption, etc.

* **Community Help:** Feel free to open a discussion or issue in this repo if you want advice. The community of contributors might share insights (e.g., if a certain GPU has known driver issues affecting performance, or if a new GPU release is around the corner that’s worth waiting for).

*By combining specs comparison and real benchmark data, you’ll be well-equipped to choose a GPU that suits your needs and budget.*

## **Project Dashboard and Website**

All the data collected is aggregated and shown on our **dashboard website** mentioned above. In addition, we may post occasional analysis or summaries in the repository Wiki or a `/docs` article (for those who prefer reading a report). For instance, as the database grows, we might write a short report like “2025 GPU Benchmark Roundup” summarizing trends (e.g., how much faster are the latest GPUs, or performance-per-dollar leaders, etc.).

The dashboard is hosted on a free platform (currently using Vercel). If it’s ever down or you prefer offline access, you can generate the charts yourself: the raw data is in `results/aggregated_results.csv` – feel free to download and plug it into your own spreadsheet or analysis tool.

## **Roadmap**

This project is under active development. Here’s a quick overview of upcoming features (see the Design Document in this repo for more details):

* **More Benchmarks:** We plan to add more tests, such as stress tests, ray-tracing performance, and additional game-like workloads.

* **Automated Testing:** We are exploring using continuous integration to run a subset of benchmarks on reference hardware for each new commit (to catch any issues).

* **Enhanced Visualization:** Filtering by GPU type (desktop vs laptop vs cloud), grouping results by driver versions, etc., on the dashboard.

* **User Requests:** If you have ideas or want a particular benchmark included, let us know\! This is a community project.
