# GPU Performance Dashboard

This dashboard displays aggregated GPU benchmark results from various contributors. The data is automatically updated when new benchmark results are submitted to the repository.

## Features

- Memory Bandwidth Comparison
- Compute Performance Metrics
- Graphics Performance Scores
- AI Inference Performance

## Data Sources

The dashboard uses data from the `results/aggregated_results.json` file, which is generated by running the `tools/aggregate_results.py` script. This script combines individual benchmark results from the `results/submissions/` directory.

## Development

To run the dashboard locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the aggregation script:
   ```bash
   python tools/aggregate_results.py
   ```
3. Open `dashboard/index.html` in your web browser

## Deployment

The dashboard is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment is handled by the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml`.
